# Simple_Tracker
My first C project. The program takes in a time, x, and y input and calculates the distance from the given input to a nearest road denoted by a slope and a y-intercept. The program then calculates the total distance along these roads between two points, the number of changes in a road, the change in direction, and the maximum speed between two points on any road.
